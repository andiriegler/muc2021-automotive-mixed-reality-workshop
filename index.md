## Introduction

With the increasing development of mixed reality (MR), the number of its purposes and applications in vehicles increases. Mixed reality may help to increase road safety, allow drivers to perform non- driving related tasks (NDRTs), and enhance passenger experiences. MR can also be helpful in the transition towards automated driving. However, there are still a number of challenges with the use of MR when applied in vehicles, and also several human factors issues need to be solved. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) has the potential to simulate mixed reality applications for HCI research, such as pedestrian and passenger experiences. In a schedule tailored to fit the requirements of a hybrid presence and online event, participants will define relevant user stories and use cases and elaborate experimental designs with measurable outcomes to contribute to the research roadmap.

## Workshop Details

Attendance: Hybrid, i.e., both in presence and virtual via Zoom and Miro

Duration: Half-day (approx. 4 hours)

Start: TBD

Schedule:

- HOUR 1: We will start off with introductions and then present key concepts in mixed reality in the context of automated driving.
- HOURS 2 & 3: Brainstorming in groups. Participants will get to design AR/VR/MR applications by choosing from a multitude of options (e.g., AR + HUD + Pedestrian Safety). The outcome will be presented by each group followed by an engaging discussion.
- HOUR 4: Participants will get to either develop more MR scenarios or use the existing ones to design user studies (e.g., how could this particular scenario be researched and validated?).
- Wrap-up: We will share the findings and discuss the participants' workshop experience.

## Participate
Every MuC 2021 participant is invited to participate in the workshop sessions. Please make sure to register via the official conference registration system.

## Organizers

- Andreas Riegler: PhD candidate and researcher at the research group Mobile Interactive Systems of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. His research interests include Automotive Computing, Mobile Computing and Human-Computer Interaction. He is currently investigating the use of Augmented and Virtual Reality for Intelligent Vehicles with focus on Windshield Displays. 
- Andreas Riener: Professor for Human-Machine Interaction and Virtual Reality at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI), Germany with co-appointment at CARISSMA (Center of Automotive Research on Integrated Safety Systems and Measurement Area). He is further leading the human-computer interaction group (HCIG) at THI. His research interests include driving ergonomics, driver state estimation from physiological measures, human factors in driver-vehicle interfaces as well as topics related to (over)trust, acceptance, and ethical issues in automated driving.
- Clemens Holzmann: Professor at the School of Informatics, Communications and Media of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. Since 2018, he is also vice president for IT of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. His research interests include Mobile Computing and Human-Computer Interaction. ​​
