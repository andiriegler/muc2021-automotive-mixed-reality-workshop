## Introduction

With the increasing development of mixed reality (MR), the number of its purposes and applications in vehicles increases. Mixed reality may help to increase road safety, allow drivers to perform non- driving related tasks (NDRTs), and enhance passenger experiences. MR can also be helpful in the transition towards automated driving. However, there are still a number of challenges with the use of MR when applied in vehicles, and also several human factors issues need to be solved. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) has the potential to simulate mixed reality applications for HCI research, such as pedestrian and passenger experiences. In a schedule tailored to fit the requirements of a hybrid presence and online event, participants will define relevant user stories and use cases and elaborate experimental designs with measurable outcomes to contribute to the research roadmap.

## Call for Papers (Submission of reflection statements, ideas, and more)

The target audience for this workshop are researchers and practitioners in the Automotive UI/HCI community, who are interested to bring forward the field of AR and VR in driving applications. We invite researchers interested in this workshop to submit reflection statements using MuC's ConfTool to the workshop organizers.

Submissions for the workshop should be compiled using the single-column ACM format. We encourage participants to submit reflection statements contributing to one or more of the workshop goals stated under "Workshop Objectives". Successful submissions will have the potential to raise discussion, provide insights for other attendees, or illustrate problems and provide potential solutions.
**Submission deadline is June 14th, 2021** via **ConfTool** (https://www.conftool.com/muc2021). Please feel free to contact the organizers at any time.

The selection of workshop participants will be done by a review process. To guarantee fair decisions, experts from the broader field of the workshop theme will serve as reviewers. Submissions need not to be anonymous.
The program committee will review the statements, and make recommendations for acceptance or rejection. Final decisions of accepting or rejecting a paper will be made by the organizers of the workshop based on the review scores and with respect to offering all workshop participants an interesting, diversified program.

## Workshop Details

Attendance: Hybrid, i.e., both in presence and virtual via Zoom and Miro

Duration: Half-day (approx. 4 hours)

Start: TBD

Schedule:

- HOUR 1: We will start off with introductions and then present key concepts in mixed reality in the context of automated driving.
- HOURS 2 & 3: Brainstorming in groups. Participants will get to design AR/VR/MR applications by choosing from a multitude of options (e.g., AR + HUD + Pedestrian Safety). The outcome will be presented by each group followed by an engaging discussion.
- HOUR 4: Participants will get to either develop more MR scenarios or use the existing ones to design user studies (e.g., how could this particular scenario be researched and validated?).
- Wrap-up: We will share the findings and discuss the participants' workshop experience.

## Participate
Every MuC 2021 participant is invited to participate in the workshop sessions. Please make sure to register via the official conference registration system.

## Organizers

- Andreas Riegler: PhD candidate and researcher at the research group Mobile Interactive Systems of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. His research interests include Automotive Computing, Mobile Computing and Human-Computer Interaction.
